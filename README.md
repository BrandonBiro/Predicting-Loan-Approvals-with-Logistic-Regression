# Predicting-Loan-Approvals-with-Logistic-Regression

This project explores the use of logistic regression to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant data. The goal is to demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques to establish loan guidelines for streamlining the loan approval process.

## Overview

I aim to identify key factors that incluence loan approval decisions by analyzing applicant data and build a predictive model using logistic regression.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:
- **Applicant Income**: The income level of the loan applicant.
- **Applicant Age**: The age of the loan applicant.
- **Loan Amount**: The amount of the loan requested.
- **Credit History**: Indicates if the applicant has a good credit history (binary: 1 or 0).
- **Loan Interest Rate**: Interest rate of approved loan.
- **Loan Percent Income**: Loan amount as percentage of annual income.
- **Loan Status**: Target variable indicating whether the loan was approved (Yes/No).

**Dataset Source**: [Loan Approval Classification Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data)

## Features of the Project

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and prepared data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized trends and relationships in the dataset.
3. **Logistic Regression Modeling**:
   - Built and evaluated a predictive model.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
